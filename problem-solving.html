	//1. Understand the Problem

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

	/*
		restate: take a string, count the characters, return the count
		inputs: string, (ask interviewer: is it a sentence? is it always going to be one work?)
				could be a sentence, alphanumeric characters (decide what you want to label your input => str)
		outputs: object with char as key and count as value, => call it charCount
	*/



    //2. Explore Concrete Examples

	//EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.

	/*
		simple: countChars("aaaa") => {a : 4} //TYPE THIS OUT WHEN YOU ASK YOUR INTERVIEWER
			ASK: What if it was like this countChars("aaaA") => {a : 3, A : 1}
				They say no, I want all of them to be considered the same A and a
					-So now you clean up code to represent this new info.
			ASK: Would I ever have an empty string? countChars(" ")
			ASK: Would I ever have a number? countChars("h3fd")
		complex: countChars("hello hey!") => {h : 2, e : 2, l : 2, o : 1 ....etc}

	*/



	//3. Break it Down

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.

    /*
		function countChars(str) {
	// 	//create a bucket
	// 	//loop through string to get chars
	// 	//check if char is alphanumeric
	// 		//ASK: Do you want EVERY letter in the string OR EVERY letter in the alphabet
	// 		//IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO CHECK FOR ALPHANUMERIC HERE'S WHAT YOU SAY:
	// 			//I know how to loop through the string but I'm
	// 	//if it is add to object
	// 	//return bucket object
	// 	let bucket = {};
	//
	// 	for(let i = 0; str.length + 1; i++) {
	// 		if(str[i] )
	// 	}
	//
	//
	// 	return bucket;
	// }
	*/



    //4. Solve || Simplify

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.
	function countChars(str) {
		//create a bucket
		let charCount = {};

		//loop through string to get chars
		for (let char of str) {
			//check if char is alphanumeric

			//You can say: I don't know how to write the expression that checks for alphanumerics
			//IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW, HERE'S WHAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT SAY: How would you tell me if a character is alphanumeric?

			//lowercase each char
			char = char.toLowerCase();
			if(/[a-z0-9]/.test(char)) {  //.test is a method for Regular Expressions
				//if it is add to object
				if(!charCount[char]) {
					charCount[char] = 1;
				} else {
					charCount[char]++;
				}
			}
		}

		//return bucket object
		return charCount;

		//Talk out loud during interview
		//Use "Let's" and "We"
	}

	console.log(countChars("hello!"));





	//5. Look Back and Refactor

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.
	function countCharsPrettier(str) {
		let charCounts = {};
		for(let char of str) {
			if(isAlphaNumeric(char)) {
				char = char.toLowerCase();
				charCounts[char] = ++charCounts[char] || 1;
			}
		}
		return charCounts;
	}


	function isAlphaNumeric(char) {
		let code = char.charCodeAt(0);
		if(!(code > 47 && code < 58) &&
				!(code > 64 && code < 91) &&
				!(code > 96 && code < 123)) {
			return false;

		} else {

		}
	}
